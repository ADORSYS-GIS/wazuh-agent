# Linux enrollment Guide

This guide walks you through the process of enrolling a Linux system with the Wazuh Manager. By following these steps, you will install and configure necessary components, ensuring secure communication between the Wazuh Agent and the Wazuh Manager.


## Prerequisites

- **Administrator Privileges:** Ensure you have sudo access.

- **Dependencies**: Have **curl, jq and sed** installed. You can install them with this command

  ```
  sudo apt-get install -y curl jq sed
  ```

## Step by step process

### Step 1: Download and Run the Setup Script

Download the setup script from the repository and run it to configure the Wazuh agent with the necessary parameters for secure communication with the Wazuh Manager.

```bash
WAZUH_MANAGER="manager.wazuh.adorsys.team" bash <(curl -SL --progress-bar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADORSYS-GIS/wazuh-agent/main/scripts/setup-agent.sh) -n
```

**Remark**: For servers with container engines, you can add **trivy** for vulnerability scanning of container images with this command:
```bash
WAZUH_MANAGER="manager.wazuh.adorsys.team" bash <(curl -SL --progress-bar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADORSYS-GIS/wazuh-agent/main/scripts/setup-agent.sh) -n -t
```

**NB:** You have other components that can be installed from this script, to know of them and how to install then run this command
```bash
WAZUH_MANAGER="manager.wazuh.adorsys.team" bash <(curl -SL --progress-bar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADORSYS-GIS/wazuh-agent/main/scripts/setup-agent.sh) -h
```

#### Components Installed by the Script:

**1. Wazuh Agent:**
Monitors your endpoint and sends data to the Wazuh Manager.
The agent is installed and configured to connect to the specified manager (WAZUH_MANAGER).

### Step 2: Enroll Agent to Manager

#### 1. Generate the Enrollment URL

Run the following command to start the enrollment process:

```bash
sudo /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-cert-oauth2-client o-auth2
```

This command will generate a URL. Copy the link and paste it into your web browser.

#### 2. Authentication via browser

- **i. Login:** You will be prompted to log in page,Log in using **Active directories: `Adorsys GIS `or `adorsys GmbH & CO KG`**, which will generate an authentication token using Keycloak.

- **ii. Two-Factor Authentication:** For first-time logins, authentication via an authenticator is required.

- **iii. Token generation:** After a successful authentication, a token will be generated. Copy the token and return to the command line.

#### 3. Complete the Enrollment

Return to the command line, paste the token, and follow the prompts to complete the enrollment process.

#### 4. Reboot your Device

Reboot your device to apply the changes.


### Step 3: Validate the Installation

After completing the agent enrollment, verify that the agent is properly connected and functioning:

#### 1. Check the Agent Status:

Look for the Wazuh icon in the system tray to confirm that the agent is running and connected.

#### 2. Validate Other Tools Installation

- YARA

```bash
  yara -v
  sudo ls -l /var/ossec/ruleset/yara/rules
```

- Snort

```bash
  snort -V
```

#### 3. Check the Wazuh Manager Dashboard:

Ping an admin for confirmation that the agent appears in the Wazuh Manager dashboard.


## Troubleshooting

- If the enrollment URL fails to generate, check internet connectivity and script permissions.

- For errors during authentication, ensure Active Directory credentials are correct and two-factor authentication is set up.

- If the **wazuh agent status app** doesn't show you as `Active` and `Connected`, check the logs for examination

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
   ```
  

## Uninstall Agent

### 1. Uninstall on User's Machine:

- Use this command to uninstall

  ```bash
  bash <(curl -SL --progress-bar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADORSYS-GIS/wazuh-agent/main/scripts/uninstall-agent.sh) -n
  ```
  **NB:** Use the `-n` option for **Snort** or the `-s` for **Suricata**. For Suricata, you do not need to specify a mode; the uninstall script will remove all Suricata components regardless of mode.

- Reboot the user's machine
  
### 2. Remove Agent from Wazuh Manager:

Shell into the **master manager node** and use this command to remove agent from wazuh manager's database

  ```bash
  /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents -r <AGENT_ID>
  ```
